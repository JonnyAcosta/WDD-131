                Mexico is a country in North America, bordered by the United States to the north and Central America to the south. With over 120 million people, it’s the most populous Spanish-speaking nation in the world.

                Mexico has a rich cultural heritage influenced by ancient civilizations like the Aztecs, Maya, and Olmecs, known for their impressive cities and monuments such as Chichén Itzá and Teotihuacan. After being colonized by Spain in 1521, Mexico’s culture fused Spanish and indigenous traditions, shaping its language, religion, and customs. Most Mexicans speak Spanish and are Catholic.
                
                Mexico is famous for its mariachi music, vibrant festivals like Día de los Muertos, and delicious food such as tacos, tamales, and mole. It’s also home to stunning landscapes, from the deserts of the north to the tropical beaches in the south, and the famous Copper Canyon.
                
                Mexico City, the capital, is a major hub for politics, culture, and business. Mexico gained independence from Spain in 1821, and today it is a modern nation blending its ancient roots with contemporary life.
